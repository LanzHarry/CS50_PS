# Problem Set 0

The simple target practice game I have made for problem set 0 can be found at:

[Target Practice V1](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1138203127)

## Submission summary

This is a simple scratch game where the player can pull a ball back in a slingshot and fire it at a target. The ball is affected by gravity and therefore arcs when released. If it hits the target then the target moves and the score is incremented.
